# PUF specification template

This repo acts as a starter template for developing new Pagero Universal Format (PUF) specifications.

## 1. How to use this template

1. Press the big green "Use this template" button above.
2. Select "Create new repository" and give it a name, e.g. "puf-clearance-notification".
3. Clone the newly generated repo via CLI or SmartGit (as usual).
4. Start writing!

## 2. How to write and build specifications

We use https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] (language) together with https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] (software) for writing and publishing PUF specifications intended for external use.

Please see https://pagero.atlassian.net/l/cp/8mVAWXfm for more detailed information, pre-requisites, installation etc.

Once you have set up your development environment, build the site by navigating to the root of the project in the terminal and write:

```
asciidoctor -a stylesheet=css/pagero.css -o index.html index.adoc
```

Now open the generated `index.html` in your browser and enjoy the result!

## 3. Things to consider

### 3.1. Rewrite README.adoc

Since all PUF repos SHOULD be public, please rewrite the `README.adoc` in the root directory to something that is sensible to share externally.

### 3.2. XYZ placeholder

Everything that MUST be updated has been named "XYZ" or "xyz", to act as a placeholder.

Please search for this within the directory structure and make sure that you replace all these values with the appropriate ones.

### 3.3. Sections to be used as-is

The "Introduction" and "Guidelines" sections have been slimmed down and can most likely be used "as-is" in new PUF specifications.

Any mention of "Invoice", "CreditNote", "EN16931", "Peppol BIS Billing 3.0" etc. has been removed.

### 3.4. XML schemas

The UBL 2.3 *common* schema library is included in this repo.

The UBL maindoc schema has to be added manually.

Any PUF extension schemas will also have to be added manually.

### 3.5. Schematron artefacts

Two empty files are available in this repo, one `.sch` and one `.xslt`.

These act only as placeholders/reminders and needs to be replaced.

## 4. Style guide

### 4.1. Use lowercase for ALL filenames

Use lowercase for all files within the repo, with dashes (-) in between words.

Example A:

- Bad: `rootElementOfAppResp.adoc`
- Good: `ubl-application-response.adoc`

Example B:

- Bad: `countrySpecfic.adoc`
- Good: `country-specifics.adoc`

### 4.2. Keep the directory structure flat

Try to keep the directory structure as flat as possible.

Let's try to not do too many `include::` that `include::` `include::` that `include::`.
